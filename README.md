## Introduction
The aim of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to mental health. The analysis focuses on understanding various factors associated with mental health issues and their prevalence.

## Technologies
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Additional Elements

### Illustrations
- Visualizations of data insights

### Scope of Functionalities
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualization 

### Examples of Use
- Analyzing the distribution of mental health conditions by gender and types of occupations.
- Identifying correlations between specific variables and mental health conditions.

### Project Status
Review process

## Personal Reflections

The project has been a very interesting experience, especially with the freedom to choose the selected dataset. However, I have encountered the limitation that all variables in this dataset are categorical, which has made it difficult for me to apply the tools we have incorporated throughout the module.

Despite this limitation, I have been able to use techniques such as contingency tables, stacked bar charts, and heatmaps to explore the relationships between different categorical variables and mental health treatment. These explorations have provided valuable insights into the distribution of treatment based on factors such as gender, occupation, and family history of mental health issues.

In the future, I would like to work with datasets that include both numerical and categorical variables to apply a more comprehensive and varied analysis. This experience has highlighted the importance of carefully choosing the right dataset for analysis and has enriched my understanding of the different techniques available to address different types of data.
