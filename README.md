# Mental Health Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains code and data to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to mental health. The analysis aims to understand various factors associated with mental health issues and their prevalence, particularly in the workplace. This project is designed to be presented during my education in data science, providing an opportunity to apply and develop data analysis skills in a practical context.

## Contents

- `Mental-Health-EDA`: Contains a Jupyter notebook with code for data analysis.
- `mental_health_datafile.zip`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis (zipped).
- `README.md`: This file, which provides a brief overview of the project and details on how to get started.

To run the analysis locally, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to access the Jupyter notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code and explore the data.

The dataset used for this analysis contains information related to mental health, including demographic factors, treatment options, and other relevant variables taken from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset].
